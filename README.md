# Array Jumper

**Array Jumper** is a simple SFML-based educational game built in C++ that visually demonstrates 1D array traversal. Players control a character that jumps across blocks representing array elements, making learning about arrays interactive and engaging.

## 🎮 Features

- Simple yet interactive gameplay
- Educational focus on how elements in a 1D array are accessed
- Lightweight, beginner-friendly source code
- Clear visual representation of array traversal

## 🖥️ 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**

## 💡 Data Structure Used

- A dynamic 1D array to represent the path
- Each element is a block with an associated number and position
- Player's current index is tracked in real-time 

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- SFML installed on your system

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Chintan-Patel-Games/Array-Jumper.git
  cd Array-Jumper
  ```

2. Compile and run

## 🕹️ Controls

- A & D - Movement for left & right
- Space – hold and use movement to jump the number of blocks mentioned on standing block
- Escape – Exit the game

## 📚 Concepts Demonstrated

- 1D Array traversal
- Basic input handling
- Collision and boundary detection
- Visual feedback tied to programming logic
